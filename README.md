<h2>The course is available for free at:</h2>
<p>

   [Coursera Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/welcome)

</p>

<h2> Description </h2>
<p>
All assignments are graded 100/100.</br>
You can consult the .java files in the src  folder, or you can import the .zip with all the assignments directly to Eclipse IDE.</br>

<h2>Disclaimer: Coursera's honour code</h2>

<p>
I made this repository with the intention of helping anyone who is stuck trying to complete the course. 
By doing so, I'm breaking Coursera's honour code.</br>
I'm doing it in part because it came to my attention that some institutions and professors are slacking off by prescribing students with free MOOCs and zero guidance.
Therefore I attempt to publish the solutions with descriptive and hopefully elucidative comments, so that they are easy to understand and to learn from.</br>
Please do try to solve the assignments and interview questions on your own and only peek at my solutions as a last resource.</li>
</p>

<h3>Todo</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Improve descriptive comments explaining the algorithms. </li>
  <li> Fix all pmd warnings. </li>
  <li> Add solutions to the interview questions </li>
  <li> Add .zip for each project so that they can be imported directly to Eclipse </li>
</ul>
