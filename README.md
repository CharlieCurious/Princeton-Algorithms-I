<h2>Disclaimer: Coursera's honour code</h2>
<p>
I made this repository with the intention of helping anyone who is stuck trying to complete the course. 
By doing so, I'm breaking Coursera's honour code.</br>
I'm doing it in part because it came to my attention that some institutions and professors are slacking off by prescribing students with free MOOCs and zero guidance.
Therefore I attempt to publish the solutions with descriptive and hopefully elucidative comments, so that they are easy to understand and to learn from.</br>
Please do try to solve the assignments and interview questions on your own and only peek at my solutions as a last resource.</li>
